        <h1 class="about-h1">About</h1>
        <p class="about-content">I have been playing around with developing since my first Java class in college. I always loved trying to figure out to make a computer work to solve problems. I majored in mathematics in college and always kept programming on through treehouse, and pluralsight. Eventually I decided programming was the only career path I wanted to take. After some research and a suggestion from my father I decided to attend The Iron Yard. On May 21, 2017 I started my programming education and continued ever since. Throughout my time there I built numerous websites and apps. I have experience in Node, React, Express, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and more. I am looking for a growing company with plenty of room to grow and develop. </p>
